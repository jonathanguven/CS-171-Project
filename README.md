Authors: [Jonathan Nguyen](https://github.com/jonathanguven) and [Brandon Nguyen](https://github.com/brandonnguyenn27)

## Description

## Project Outline

### Data Collection Plan
We will parse website data or find a public dataset for our project.
### Model Plans

## Project Timeline

### Week 1: Project Definition and Finding Datasets

**Goals**

- Determine **research question** / problem statement.
- Select **two real-world datasets** (one per partner) to support the machine-learning modeling.
- Discuss / finalize dataset choices with each other.

**Deliverables**

- Create GitHub repository and project structure
- Complete GitHub README file.

### Week 2: Data Pre-processing Notebooks

**Goals**

- Each partner writes their **data preprocessing notebook**
- Includes: data cleaning, transformations, feature engineering, and train/test/validation splits
- Confirm reproducibility
- Document each step with Markdown cells

**Deliverables**

- Completed data preprocessing notebook for each partner's dataset
- Dataset ready for model training

### Week 3: Model Construction and Training

**Goals**

- Design and train **one model per partner**.
- Record hyperparameters and evaluation metrics
- Record and visualize model performance on training sets

**Deliverables**

- Completed model construction notebook with model training and evaluation
- Reproducibility test on both partner's machines

### Week 4: Analysis and Visualization Notebooks

**Goals**

- Analyze performance of trained model against validation dataset with plots and charts.
- Tie visualizations to insights related to the research question
- Refine model as necessary

**Deliverables**

- Completed analysis notebook with comments, code, and Markdown cells complete.
- Verify reproducibility for different environments.

### Week 5: Final Review and Presentation Preparation

**Goals**

- Polish all notebooks
- Continue to verify reproducibility for clean environments
- Finalize slides for **Dec2-4 presentations**
- Practice live demo of notebooks and visualizations

**Deliverables**

- Final GitHub repository with completed notebooks and datasets, ready for submission
- Polished presentation slides.
